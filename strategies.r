# We maintain the belief-goal-action view.

# The goal can be either directly from the environment,
# or implicitly assumed by the decision rule.

# A strategy actually consists of (at least) two parts:
# the decision rule, which takes in a belief and outputs an action,
# and a belief revision rule, which takes in the current belief
# and the new information, and outputs a new belief

# In this sense, the action-value methods all share 
# the same belief revision rule.
